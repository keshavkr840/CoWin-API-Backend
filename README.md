# Track Vaccination Center CoWin 
This is a demo project where I made a login and signup page. The signup page captures user details like their name , address, pincode, state, vaccinated status, etc. and saves that in db. When user logs in the website a 15 digit token is generated, also an API call is made to the CoWIN public API that returns The vaccination centers in your locality.
